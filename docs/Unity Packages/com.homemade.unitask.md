### **This is the package from [Cysharp - Unitask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask).**

You can check out the github link for more document how to use it.<br/>
The reason I create into my own package because I would had more easy to set up dependency for my other packages.
And this also helps in setting up the Unity package management system.
